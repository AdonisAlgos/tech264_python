# level 1
# Greet the user
print('Hi there!')

# Print a list of starters
print(['hummus', 'bread', 'olives'])

# Take an input for the user for their starter
customer_order_list = []
customer_order_list.append(input('What started would you like? '))

# Print a list of mains
print(['lamb','pizza','fish'])

# Take an input for the user for their main course
customer_order_list.append(input('What would you like for a main? '))

# Print a list of desserts
print(['fruit', 'ice-cream', 'cake'])

# Take an input for the user for their dessert
customer_order_list.append(input('And what would you like as a dessert'))

# Print all of the user's choices
print(f'You have ordered {customer_order_list[0]} as a starter, {customer_order_list[1]} as a main and to finish off, {customer_order_list[2]} as a dessert.')

# level 2
# Use at least one f-string
# Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'

# level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
# Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

# level 4
# Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
